This is a small software project which I developed in my Bachelors degree.
The applications has some libraries for a circular Buffer, data input and output etc.
It has also some unit tests for the modules, where I learned some basic unit testing skills.
It runs a commando line tool which sends data through UART to the Arduino and gets the answer back.
In the Python file there is a temperature application which runs over MQTT. After a specific average temperature is reached (average related to the group of Arduinos which are connected to the MQTT Server) all lamps of the application turn on.
